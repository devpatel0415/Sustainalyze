# 🌱 Sustainalyze

**Sustainalyze** is a data science portfolio that explores the powerful intersection of **sustainability** and **data analytics**. This repository features real-world projects designed to uncover actionable insights from environmental data, addressing key global issues like:

- 🌍 Carbon emissions & greenhouse gases  
- ♻️ Landfill diversion & waste reduction  
- ⚡ Energy recovery & resource efficiency  
- 🏭 Sustainable supply chain analysis  

## 🎯 Purpose

The aim of this repository is to demonstrate how data science can inform and advance sustainability efforts by:

- Cleaning, visualizing, and modeling environmental datasets  
- Identifying patterns and inefficiencies in emissions and waste systems  
- Supporting evidence-based decision-making for a more sustainable future  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Publicly available datasets (EPA, USEEIO, etc.)

## 📁 Projects

- `2022 U.S.Supply-Chain-Emissions`: Investigating margin impacts on GHG emissions across industries.
- *More coming soon...*

## 📌 Get Involved
